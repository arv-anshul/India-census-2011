# India Census 2011 Dashboard

After taking the session of **CampusX DSMP Program**. I decided that this would be a good project to improve my **Data Wrangling and Data Interpretation** ability.

## Process of Thinking | Notetaking

### 1. For Populations data :

- Plot a `scatter_mapbox` for each _States and Districts_.
- Plot a `pie chart` for `male-female` distributions in _States_. _Do this only for States._

### 2. For Literacy Data :

- Plot a `scatter_mapbox` for each _States and Districts_.
- Plot a `pie chart` for `male-female` distribution in _States_.

### 3. For Castes Group Data :

- This data contains two caste groups `SC & ST`. So we can plot the only the `pie charts` for each _States_.
- For Districts we can plot the `nested pie plot` for each **States's Districts**.\*

### 4. For Religions Data :

- This contains _maybe_ five religions overall. So we have again plot the `nested pie plot` for each _States and Districts_.
